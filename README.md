# floating_point_assignment
Assignment to add floating points and doubles.

This is an assignment from CISC340 meant to show the inconsistency between doubles and floating point values. 
The java file adds the values "1/2" and "1/3" as both floating points and doubles then outputs the results to a txt file.
